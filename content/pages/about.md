Ciao! I'm **Mattia**, a 23 years old student based in Provaglio d'Iseo, Italy. I graduated in 2023 from in **Computer Science** at Milano-Bicocca University. I am now attending a **Master's Degree** in Computer Science at Milano-Bicocca University.

I have a [**B2 English Cambridge Certificate**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16bkBccFPPHTTRpmC1qb2y8NQIouHUsMn/view?usp=sharing).  

I partecipated in an **Erasmus+** project in 2019, going abroad for 3 weeks in Berlin and I was a member of our school **First Tech Challenge** team where our robot competed in [Barcelona in 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rJRK7LRTeA).  

I worked for [**sme.up**](https://www.smeup.com/), a local ERP software house for a 4-month internship.

In the summer of 2024, I've partecipated in **Google Summer of Code** program. I've worked with **OpenStreetMap** to integrate Panoramax, a streetlevel image service, into iD, OSM online editor. You can find out more [in my journal](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Juicio/diary). [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xsxeHFRMuEPKfCvRdMD5oUHcFn2Bt-Tx/view?usp=sharing) you can find my certificate.  
From November 2024 to May 2025, I've continued to work with OpenStreetMap on my **Master Thesis**: *"Study, Analysis and Development of Object Lifecycle Mapping in OpenStreetMap's iD editor"*.  
Both times I've worked with the classic **HTML, CSS, JS** stack using **D3.js**.

I really love to travel, to hike and to climb. In my spare time I usually play [videogames](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Juicio/).
